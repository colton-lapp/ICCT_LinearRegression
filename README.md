## Explaining Simple Linear Regression

### Description:
As part of a technical job interview, I created a presentation to demonstrate the concept of a simple linear regression in the context of estimating the effect of gas prices on vehicle miles traveled (VMT). I used python to create visualizations in Matplotlib and developed a supporting presentation which is uploaded here.
